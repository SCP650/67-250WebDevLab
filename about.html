            <p>Nice to meet ya!</p>

          <p>I am a kid who likes to try new things. So I guess a short summary of my "career" would be: I held charity campaigns and fundraisings for animal protection causes; I lead the organization of a 5-day entrepreneurship summer camp for high school students twice; I lead the design of a space settlement orbiting Mercury for NASA and won the first prize in China; I co-founded a mobile app Transease and won the World Top 50 in Microsoft Imagine Cup; I held the first TEDxYouth talk in my city; I am also involved in debate, model UN and case competitions;

        <p> Right now I am focusing on game design with Unity and data analysis and visulization with R and tableau. I also have an on-campus job in CMU's Interntional Developmen department. I am responsible for helping with CMU's alumini relationship and social media presense in mainland China, HK, Taiwan, India, Singapore, Pakistain and Tailand. So in my <a href="smartSeb.html" > portfolio </a>, you can see my work ranging from the soft side of business to the technical side of things.</p>

    <p>Sadly, this is a website. I cannot know who you are or what your story is. But please, feel free to reach out to me. I would love to learn more about you and I am always available for a coffee chat.</p>
