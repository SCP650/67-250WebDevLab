This is a game-design/research class taught by Professor Tom Corbett where we work in teams to design video games in VR/AR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this project, we designed a VR rhythm dancing game. Our original idea was to use ML and OpenCV so that the player can dance freely. Then we realized that is not gamey enough. The final result is a beat-saber-like node-hitting dancing game — as you hit the nodes, you begin to boogie. We knew we succeed when during the final demo, not only the person in VR is dancing, but the entire class spontaneously started dancing to the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this 6-week project, I was the programmer in the team. We will go through 6 iterations for the game, developing a prototype for each week and presenting a demo on every Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a team project for CMU 53-451: Research Issues in Game Development: Designing for XR. This is a game-design/research class taught by Professor Tom Corbett where we work in teams to design video games in VR/AR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this project, we designed a golf-dating-sim called PuttPlot. Essentially, it is a Japanese-style dating sim but you choose your response by golfing the ball to the corresponding holes. This is both challenging and fun in that we need to simulate the 3D golfing gestures and physics in VR but at the same time tell an interesting story through 2D animations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this 6-week project, I was the producer/programmer in the team. We will go through 6 iterations for the game, developing a prototype for each week and presenting a demo on every Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is our story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;week-1---brain-storming&quot;&gt;Week 1 - Brain Storming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a lot of freedom in our project. The only requirement was that it needed to be a playable VR game inspired by any picnic game. And, of course, it needed to be developed within 6-week by a team of 5-6 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We formed our team on Friday, Aug 30th. On the next day, we had our first meeting. In the meeting, we spend about 4 hours talking about game ideas. Our discussion ranged from a technical-challenged beat-saber-style &lt;em&gt;Hall Ball&lt;/em&gt; to an Americano dark-humor game called &lt;em&gt;Catch With Dad&lt;/em&gt;. The game idea I proposed was an environmental-educational sandbox game called &lt;em&gt;Tree&lt;/em&gt; where you grow and destroy tress to impact global temperature. Sadly, it is a bit out of scope for a 6-week project so we didn’t end up running it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After several rounds of voting, we ended up with the idea of a dating simulation golf game: &lt;em&gt;PuttPlot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;producing&quot;&gt;Producing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we decided the game idea, we need to present a playable demo that following Friday. We cooperated by assigning tasks to each individual in the team. These were tasks like demo-board design, 2D arts and hitting mechanics. All individual task would be due by Wednesday night. And we would use Thursday night to integrate all the individual parts into a full game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;programming&quot;&gt;Programming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our first demo, we just used rigid-body on the ball and added a collider on the golf club. We would add a force on the ball to the direction of the club whenever the ball was hit. So Unity physics will handle the collision and how golf ball would fly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did pretty well for our first week. Our demo is working and the class seems to like it. We also received a lot of constructive feedback.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;week-2---pre-production&quot;&gt;Week 2 - Pre-Production&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get things going, we did a lot of pre-production work this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;producing-1&quot;&gt;Producing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we decided on the three pillars of the game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Laughter: the game should be very very funny / subverted expectations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engaging stories: player’s decisions matter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Board configuration connect to dialogue options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our game mainly consisted of two parts: a golfing mechanics and an intriguing story. So for the second week, our writer Gus worked on the story and ended up with a bunch of index card full of funny stories he wrote. Our artiest Angelina worked on more concepts and character art. Our programmer Carter and Ann worked on driving golf. And I worked on the board design and producing work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still used the integrate-on-Thursday-present-on-Friday approach. Since a lot of the work we did is preproduction, the final demo we presented on Friday for this week isn’t that much different from the previous week.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
    
      &lt;a href=&quot; /images/projects/PuttPlot/week2-story.png&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&quot; /images/projects/PuttPlot/week2-story.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;w-100&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    
        &lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;Draft story tree for the game&lt;/p&gt;
    


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;programming-1&quot;&gt;Programming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week we try to mimic how golf ball in the real world works. In real life, the golf ball will not fly away immediately after contact with the club, but will instead be lifted a bit by the club and the fly away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, we try to do that in the game by adding the ball to be a child object of the club immediately after contact so that it would stick to the club. After the ball move up to the direction of the swing for a few milliseconds, we will release the ball and adding a force to make it fly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concept is good but the final result wasn’t as successful as we would want it to be. The ball still moves too fast and didn’t land on the location you would expect it to land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feedback-for-this-week&quot;&gt;Feedback for this week&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same as last week, we received a lot of feedback after our demo on Friday and we boiled down to four points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ball was too fast/not visible enough&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Text looked bad&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Board UI needed work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Driving doesn’t feel good. Need a RAMP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, we forget to record gameplay video in the first two iterations so you won’t be able to see them.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    
        &lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;The second iteration&lt;/p&gt;
    


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;week-3---a-rough-week-&quot;&gt;Week 3 - A Rough Week :(&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our third iteration of the game, things started to get a bit difficult. We had the Technical Opportunities Conference this week, which is the biggest career fair on CMU each year. Many teammates spent all their free time on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday in that event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;producing-2&quot;&gt;Producing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This essentially meant our Wednesday checkpoint was not met. So we ended up trying to scramble everything together at the last minute. Carter, Gus and I stayed at Hunt Library basement until after midnight. Even after that, the version we submitted was still very buggy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I designed several levels(boards) for the game. But because we failed to get the dialogue transition working in time. We never got a chance to transit to the new levels. Therefore, our demo on Friday was not ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;programming---a-ramp-is-built&quot;&gt;Programming - A Ramp is Built&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing was we got a working ramp. One of the feedback that we received was that just driving the ball to the board did’t feel good. We solved this by adding an acceleration ramp. In this case, the player only needs to putt the ball to the ramp and ball will fly up to the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, we will do better next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;week-4---play-testing&quot;&gt;Week 4 - Play-Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are officially passing the halfway point of our project but we still haven’t got the core game loop ready. So there is only one goal this week: nail down the game loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;producing---a-small-bug&quot;&gt;Producing - A “Small” Bug&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning from last week’s experience, we tried to add more checkpoints and iterations throughout the week. Instead of only integrating on Thursday night, we integrated and play-test on Tuesday night and integrated again on Wednesday and Thursday nights. This meant we could at least iterate two times in one week: one for play-testing on Tuesday and one for the demo on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, we were fixing bugs while inviting people to play-test. Near the end of the play-test session, we fixed all the bugs that are left from last week, especially a bug that will prevent the dialogue from moving to the next board and options.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
    
      &lt;a href=&quot; /images/projects/PuttPlot/week4-environment.png&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&quot; /images/projects/PuttPlot/week4-environment.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;w-100&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    
        &lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;Week4 the environment behind the player&lt;/p&gt;
    


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- source from https://superdevresources.com/image-caption-jekyll/ --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we found a smaller bug. Instead of creating a new ball and destroy old ones, we cycled through golf balls. This meant there are only 10 golf balls in total in the game. We created these ball at the beginning of the game and when you hit the ball with index 9, the ball with index 0 will come back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But since we only changed its transform.location, there were still forces on the ball if the player went through all the balls very quickly. Since we were play-testing, there was no time to rewrite the script, we just changed the number of balls from 10 to 100000000 in the editor, thinking there is no way a player could go through 100000000 balls that quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hit the play button, without thinking twice. But apparently, initializing 100000000 game objects in a for-loop at the beginning of the game is a bad idea …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unity stopped responding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were thinking: “Cool, I’ll just have to reopen Unity and change the number back.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we forgot to save the scene before entering that huge number…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So all the modifications we made that night in the scene was gone…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;producing-cont&quot;&gt;Producing (CONT)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All was not lost. We integrated again on Wednesday to revert all the changes we made on Tuesday. And we also integrated on Thursday to add more features like background, voice and more dialogue. At around 11:20 pm on Thursday, when we tried to integrate all the dialogue scriptable objects and voice to our main game, the game broke again because my teammates were using the older version of the event system (the one from last week) and we changed the system since then…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent 10-20 mins trying to fix this issue. This meant we only have 20 mins left to integrate. We have to make a hard choice, either we could put all the dialogue in so the player can play a full game without voice acting, or we could put the dialogue and voice acting for the first scene so the player can experience a shorter but complete game loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the producer, it was a hard choice for me to make. Because both sides have spent a lot of time tonight working and both would like their stuff in the game. But I decided to go with the latter because a short snapshot of our game can provide people a better understanding of the game and what the game would look like once it is finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;programming---the-ramp-is-on-fire&quot;&gt;Programming - The Ramp Is on Fire&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We moved the golf ball’s location around and didn’t have time to recalibrate the boosting ramp. So in our demo on Friday, when our TA Adrian tested the game, the ramp boosted too much and he overshot the ball a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;lesson-learned&quot;&gt;Lesson Learned&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If something can go wrong, it will go wrong… So save files periodically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;week-5---things-are-finally-coming-together&quot;&gt;Week 5 - Things Are Finally Coming Together&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With two weeks to go, we finally nailed down our core game loop. This week we got all the major elements integrated: story, putting, environment and some voice acting in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;producing-3&quot;&gt;Producing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the organizational changes, we made last week worked, we again play-tested our game on Tuesday night and integrate it on Wednesday and Thursday night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because our game is dialogue-focused, once we got the dialogue system set up the game would work decently. So this week we saw all the previous debugging and coding efforts finally paid off (special thanks to our lead programmer Carter). We also added a chat history on the sides of the player, so that the player can see the previous chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;programming---the-ramp-is-never-on&quot;&gt;Programming - The Ramp is Never On&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that in week 3 we added a ramp？And in week 4 the ramp makes the player overshot a lot? This was actually kind of wired because in week 3 the ramp would not cause as much overshooting as it did in week 4. So this week we try to solve that problem by recalibrating the ramp and the ball’s landing location on the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the entire evening with a headset on in our VR game while Carter tweaked parameters for the ramp. Each time he tweaked something, I would the ramp and see where the ball lands. And each time we do that, we would convince ourselves that we are almost there, just a few more tweaks to go.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    
        &lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;Recalibrating the Ramp&lt;/p&gt;
    


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while, we were a bit frustrated because no matter how we tweak the parameters, the ramp would always overshoot. Wait a minute, no matter how we change the parameters … the outcome would not change… it could only be … but that’s impossible …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep, the ramp’s collider was never turned on. The collider that was supposed to detect and boost the ball, the collider that we thought we were changing was never on. We must have turned it off during some testing and forgot to turn it back on. Because it was off, it had absolutely no effects in the game. And we just spent about an hour trying to “fix” it…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we turn the collider on, everything worked decently. In our demo on Friday, our guest, a naive play-tester, seemed impressed by our game, especially how easy the putting feels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lesson-learned-1&quot;&gt;Lesson Learned&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;week-6---release&quot;&gt;Week 6 - Release&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is our final week to work on the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;producing-4&quot;&gt;Producing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After play-testing the game on Tuesday, we listed 10-12 additional features and improvements we wanted to add to the game. Our biggest challenge this week was getting all the voice and dialogue lines in. As I have said before, once we got the main dialogue system working, it would just be a matter of click and drag all the files in. But since we were trying to create a funny dating simulator, we have a long story (consisted of 7 short stories with branches). It took us a long time to put all the dialogue lines and its’ corresponding voice acting in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At around 9:30 pm on Thursday, we managed to get the whole game working (without voice acting). I play-tested the entire game while our writer Gus was putting voices into the scriptable objects for each dialogue. Surprisingly, because we had too many jokes and stories, it took me a good 20-30 minutes to finish the entire game. The version we had right now would be our last-known-good in case things went south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finished adding all the voices acting in at around 10:50 - 11:00 pm, about one hour before the deadline. Then, things went south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;programming---the-ramp-broke-again&quot;&gt;Programming - The Ramp Broke, Again&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The programming section of this article was created to talk about the technical challenges we faced during the game development. But I just realized almost all of them are actually about the ramp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At around 11:00 pm, one hour before the deadline, we decided to recalibrate the ramp (again). This was because we added a tutorial to this game. The tutorial would ask the player to shoot the far left and far right of the board, so that players would know how to control the putting. But, currently, shooting to the side would cause a bug on the ramp, making the golf ball never land on the board. We never notice this problem last week because we did not add the tutorial until this week. So with one hour to go, we started debugging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carter and I started our classic duel: He would tweak different parameters on the ramp and I would be in the headset hitting the golf ball and giving him feedback. But we encountered the same problem: no matter how we tweak the parameters, the boosting effect would not be activated for all the balls landing on the far sides of the ramp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We checked the collider, yes, it was on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At around 11:45 pm, the atmosphere was tense. On the one hand, hitting the ball up through the ramp was our core game mechanics, we have an obligation to make it work. On the other hand, we had no idea whether we could solve this bug or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 11:50 pm, we found the bug. It was one line of code in the ramp’s script that narrowed the range of checking collision. After we simply commented it out, things worked beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, we presented our game to the whole class. Even though we still had some problems with the putting, the play-test went well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, I made a mistake here. I should have built the game after we added all the voice acting and before we started debugging the ramp. This is because our last-know-good was the version built around 9:30 pm. It did not have all the voice acting in. Had the debugging effort failed, and the game fails to compile before midnight, all the effort of recording the voice acting and adding it to the game would be lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my first time working on a game as producer. It is really a learning experience for me. I am very grateful to have a supportive team. I’d really like to give a shout-out to our programmer Carter Williams, our writer Gus Saalfeld and our artiest Angelina Shi. This game would not be possible without their’s and all our teammates contribution.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Product_Project_Management" /><category term="Game_Design" /><category term="All" /><summary type="html">Published on Oct 29, 2019.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">BigSkinny</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/projects/2019/spring/BigSkinny" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="BigSkinny" /><published>2019-08-13T16:00:23-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-13T16:00:23-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/projects/2019/spring/BigSkinny</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/projects/2019/spring/BigSkinny">&lt;p&gt;This is the term project for CMU 67-250: The Information Systems Milieux.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big Skinny is an e-commerce wallet company that sells thin wallets. Because of the unique material it uses, the company can produce surprisingly thin and lightweight wallets that are also water resistant and can be machine washed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems like a great product, but in reality, this company is facing plummeting sales and its yelp page is filled with negative one-star reviews.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what went wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;problems&quot;&gt;Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon reviewing the company, my team and I concluded three major problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one is its bad website design. It’s hard to navigate and includes too much text and options. You can expereince it first-hand &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bigskinny.net&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
    
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bigskinny.net&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
      
        &lt;img src=&quot; /images/projects/BigSkinny/index.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;w-100&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    
        &lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;Home Page of Big Skinny&lt;/p&gt;
    


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- source from https://superdevresources.com/image-caption-jekyll/ --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is their front page when we took over. As you can see, different components were not aligned, tags and buttons are confusing (what does “CARD CASES + $ CLIPS” even means??). I hate to say this but the whole site left me with an impression of a high school project done at the last minute. Because of the bad user interface design, the conversion rate for somebody redirected to this website through online ads is guaranteed to be low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second problem is its lack of a target customer group. In its website, it tries to target men, women, travelers, police officers, teenagers, businessmen, and women, as well as random customer group with products like “Paper watch” and “Stainless Steel Mesh Wallet Comb” that doesn’t make any sense for a wallet company to sell.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
    
      &lt;a href=&quot; /images/projects/BigSkinny/page.png&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&quot; /images/projects/BigSkinny/page.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;w-100&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    
    &lt;br /&gt;
    


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- source from https://superdevresources.com/image-caption-jekyll/ --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big Skinny is the textbook classic company that tries to fit all markets. By providing more than 40+ Wallets for people to choose and tons of unnecessary accessories, the company try to please everyone and got no one in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third one is poor database management. In the yelp page, many people left a negative review because of an incident in 2010. In this incident, more than 4000 people ordered wallets through Big Skinny’s website. But because of a “glitch in an online promotion” as Big Skinny CEO Kiril Alexandrov put it, most of the wallets were given for free. Technical difficulties with promotion coupons appeared multiple times ever since, as can be seen in 2013 and 2017. This can be attributed to bad database structure and management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-proposal&quot;&gt;Our Proposal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve Big Skinny’s sales, we first need to rebrand the company. Thus, we identified a target customer group: young travelers. This is because big skinny’s waterproof thin wallet fit the need of travelers and hikers. Then, we identified three major problems with its current website: lengthy words, disorganized layout, too many choices to narrow down to one product. And by deploying online marketing campaigns directly targeting young travelers and redesigning our website to provide a youth-centered user experience that can attract and assist young travelers in buying and selecting wallets. Finally, we come up with a new database relationship system that can hopefully avoid further coupon problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;marketing&quot;&gt;Marketing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To target young gen Z travelers, we initiated the “Built for the Courageous” online marketing campaign. As a part of this campaign, Big Skinny will need at least one person dedicated solely to consistently creating new content and synthesizing customer testimonials for future advertisements. Part of this campaign will include new media for all platforms, such as a Facebook video ad to target and draw in the young traveler demographic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-website&quot;&gt;New website&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we allured customer with ads to our website, we need to provide an easy-to-use user experience. Thus, we first re-designed the website by organizing its information architecture in a clean and easy to follow manner. We designed a clear navigation bar and cut down words in the index page from 200 words to around 50 words while keeping essential information. By accompanied them with images, we can make them more readable for the customer.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;interactive-wallet-selection-guide&quot;&gt;Interactive Wallet Selection Guide&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, to help customers narrow their choices from 40+ wallet designs to one wallet, we designed an interactive wallet selection guide.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-user-story&quot;&gt;A User Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say Jack is a 20-year-old college graduate, While browsing Facebook one day, he saw a short video about this amazingly slim wallet. This video is actually a Facebook ad we bought in the online marketing campaign. By the end of the video, he saw a line says “Build for the courageous”. As a traveler, he was inspired to click the link to go to our website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon visiting our website, the first thing he saw is this inspiring image and as he scrolled down he saw all the advantages of Big Skinny wallets. Just as he was about to buy one, he saw the wallet selection guide and clicked it. There, he can select his preferences and the site will provide recommendations.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
    
      &lt;a href=&quot; /images/projects/BigSkinny/question.png&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&quot; /images/projects/BigSkinny/question.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;w-100&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    
    &lt;br /&gt;
    


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- source from https://superdevresources.com/image-caption-jekyll/ --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Wow, these recommendations seem great. let me check out this wallet”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the product info page, we simplified all the product information. So, customers can learn more about the wallet quickly and place an order quickly.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
    
      &lt;a href=&quot; /images/projects/BigSkinny/recommand.png&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&quot; /images/projects/BigSkinny/recommand.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;w-100&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    
    &lt;br /&gt;
    


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- source from https://superdevresources.com/image-caption-jekyll/ --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“This looks great. I will take it!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the end of one transaction, but not the end of our relationship with this customer. Using our database system, a week after Jack bought the first wallet, we will recommend a second category of wallet, such as a leather wallet different from the one customer originally purchased, and advertise it in an email saying, “One for outdoors and one for indoors.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, by integrating market research, database design, and website design, this solution will emphasize Big Skinny’s strengths and improved customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;Credits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the two weeks of our term project, my role is sort of like the “product manger” in the team. I set up the overall goal and communicate with each individual about their design, provide them with feedback, make sure the production timeline is working and keep track of the scope of our term project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the four of us cannot meet frequently, I coordinate the team to make sure we are all on the same page and the Executive summary, web prototype, ERD and our presentation are tightly integrated. On the other hand, my friend Christine, Megan and Jonathan are responsible for the actual work.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overall-structure&quot;&gt;Overall Structure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This game has 7 different scenes: StartScreen, SinglePlayerMode, TwoPlayerMode, ThreePlayerMode, InstructionsScreen, RankScreen, and EasterMode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because pygame doesn’t support scenes switching like the ones in Unity, I wrote some scene switching codes that basically calls to different redrawAll or timerFired when in a different mode. I think this method is covered in class as well so I will not elaborate further here. You can learn more here:&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.krivers.net/15112-s18/notes/notes-animations-demos.html&quot;&gt; Mode Demo &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;multiplayer-mode&quot;&gt;Multiplayer Mode&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local two-player multiplayer mode is the MVP for this game. The tricky part is how to check collision between tanks and the map as well as bullets and the map. The map is generated as a png image with walls as black pixels and passage as transparent background (zero alpha channel). The tank is just a sprite image of a cartoon tank.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    
        &lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;Two Player Mode&lt;/p&gt;
    


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many friends of mine, who are in spring 2019 112 class, try to use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
pygame.sprite.collide(self,map)&lt;/code&gt;
in their games. This may not work because sprite.collide treats the map as a sprite aka as a whole image. Since the map is below your game object (tanks in my case), your game object will always collide with the map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, there is a neat function called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pygame.sprite.collide_mask(self,map)&lt;/code&gt;. This would work properly because this function creates a “mask” for the map. Namely, it creates a new “image” with the pixels that are of non-zero alpha channels only. Hence, in my case, only the black walls will be considered for collision, but the transparent passage will not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing you might want to look out for in MVP is the frame rate. In my first prototype, the bullets speed per second is faster than the frame rate per second. Due to high speed, it can move to pass the width of the wall before the next collision check. Hence, the bouncy wall effect I wanted cannot be achieved. At first, I thought this was a programming problem, so I kept trying to tweak the collision method. So just beware that frame rate can mess with your collision test.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished one tank without AI in the first iteration. After finishing the two-player mode in the second iteration, I added a three-player mode in the third iteration. The third player will use a mouse to navigate and right click to shoot bullets. This is not very hard to implement once you got all the base code ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;game-ai-mode&quot;&gt;Game AI Mode&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh boy, this is the hardest part of the game. I need to program an AI tank that can navigate, shoot and avoid bullets. Theoretically, if I have the map stored in a 2D list, I can just use a backtrack function and update AI’s path periodically. The algorithms would not be very hard to write. The problem, though, is that I did not store the map in a 2D list.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
    
      &lt;a href=&quot; /images/projects/15112/AI_Mode.png&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&quot; /images/projects/15112/AI_Mode.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;w-100&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    
        &lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;AI Mode&lt;/p&gt;
    


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- source from https://superdevresources.com/image-caption-jekyll/ --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to simplify my MVP, I initially used a photoshopped image of the map. During my second iteration, I cannot think of an efficient way to generate a map using backtracking. This is because I need to avoid close containment of any size so that the tanks will not be trapped in one area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to keep the project moving, I chose to avoid this path. In my second iteration, I simply make the AI tank simple turn right every time it hits a wall. This will make the AI tank appears to be moving around. As you may have guessed, the downside is the tank sometimes will be trap in a circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my third iteration, I write a “ray casting” function. Basically, I will send out 8 different bullets to 8 direction periodically. These bullets will not be drawn. This ray cast can let the tank know which direction has more space and which direction is a dead end. The tank can then make a decision about turning base on this information.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
    
      &lt;a href=&quot; /images/projects/15112/Ray_Casting.png&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    
        &lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;Ray Casting&lt;/p&gt;
    


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After fine-tuning for a long time, the game AI works pretty well. I feel like you can always try to come up with creative ways to implement game AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;easter-mode&quot;&gt;Easter Mode&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the fourth iteration, I added some powerups that change tank size and speed, a ranking screen that stores past scores locally, as well as an Easter mode. You can trigger the Easter mode by messing around in the starter screen. Feel free to play around and try to break the game  :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;areas-for-improvement&quot;&gt;Areas for Improvement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I have more time, I would try to come up with a map generation algorithm. This will enable the game to have random maps and the game AI can also be more interesting. It would also be fun to add a mode where two AI tanks fight each other.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Game_Design" /><category term="All" /><summary type="html">This project is dedicated to Scott Chen For being my “sametable” in high school</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Transease</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/projects/2018/spring/Transease" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Transease" /><published>2019-08-10T14:37:52-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-10T14:37:52-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/projects/2018/spring/Transease</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/projects/2018/spring/Transease">&lt;p&gt;In my third year in high school, we have a new teacher named Mark coming from England. But the problem is that he cannot speak Chinese at all. So, when he needed to rent a house or talk to the locals, he needed us to help translate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This got me thinking. Wouldn’t it be so nice if every time people need translation, somebody can just magically show up and help them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being inspired by Uber, I come up with a real-time human translation app that can achieve just that at a low price. By working with my friends Tony Lian and Yujie Wang, we came up with a prototype and won the world top 50 in the 2018 Microsoft Imagine Cup Big Idea Challenge. We are also the only team from mainland China that receive such prize in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;problem&quot;&gt;Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been to 17 different countries, but I can only speak two languages. Hence, trying to communicate across different languages have always been a problem I wanted to solve. Currently, people tend to use free online translation apps like Google translate or hire an expensive translator. The problem is these translation apps are inaccurate. Here is one example. Even though the Chinese “能穿多少穿多少” is the same, it actually has totally different meanings in different settings. In the following case, it actually means “It’s hot, wear as little clothes as you can.”
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- source from https://superdevresources.com/image-caption-jekyll/ --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for hiring translators, well, it’s way too expensive. So, I want to see if there is a middle ground that can make a translation by human affordable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;solution&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uber fascinates me because its core idea is so simple, yet it solves a huge problem in our society. If Uber can connect available drivers with people who need rides, why couldn’t we connect available translators with people who need translation service?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one-user-story&quot;&gt;One User Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jieke is a Chinese traveler visiting the US. He wanted to talk to a local shop owner for about 10 minutes about their business, but he cannot speak English. So, he opens our app Transease in his phone and clicks “Translate”.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
    
      &lt;a href=&quot; /images/projects/Transease/1.png&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&quot; /images/projects/Transease/1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;w-100&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    
    &lt;br /&gt;
    


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- source from https://superdevresources.com/image-caption-jekyll/ --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our system will search for whoever is available and connect them with Jieke&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say on the other side of the globe, an American exchange student Jack just finishes his class in a Chinese university. He can speak English and Chinese and have about 10 minutes available. He can open our app and click “start receiving jobs”.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
    
      &lt;a href=&quot; /images/projects/Transease/2.png&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&quot; /images/projects/Transease/2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;w-100&quot; /&gt;

&lt;!-- source from https://superdevresources.com/image-caption-jekyll/ --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our system will then connect Jack with Jieke, and let Jack translate for Jieke via voice call. After the service, Jack will receive a small fee from Jieke. And , Jieke can rate his experience with Jack and continue his travel until he needs translation service again.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prototype&quot;&gt;Prototype&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sure this will actually work, I came up with an MVP. I asked 6 friends who can speak Chinese and English to help out. I put their contact info in a table showing their available timeslots. I also recruited two foreign teachers who cannot speak Chinese very well to be our test subjects. Basically, in the MVP, whenever the subjects need translation service, he or she can look up the table and call the number that is available during that timeslot. The person who is available will translate for them via the phone call.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
    
      &lt;a href=&quot; /images/projects/Transease/Call_Table.png&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&quot; /images/projects/Transease/Call_Table.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;w-100&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    
        &lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;Call Table&lt;/p&gt;
    


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- source from https://superdevresources.com/image-caption-jekyll/ --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This MVP is like a proof of concept to show translation over voice call actually works. We received many feedbacks. And we try to address most of the problem in our first prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid the high costs of developing apps for different platforms, our first prototype is a website that is optimized for mobile users. It has login and voice calling features. We added more features such as ratings and video chat as we went. This prototype helped us win the Big Idea Challenge In 2018 Microsoft Imagine Cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;potential-development&quot;&gt;Potential Development&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the middle stage of our project, I realize a more significant problem. Our app can easily be replaced if the translation algorithm is good enough. And since people are used to using free translation apps, how can we encourage them to spend a few more bucks to use a human translator?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I have more time, these are the areas I would try to improve. First, I would like to hold another user testing this time asking people to actually pay for the service. Then, through more iterations, I would like to improve our app’s UI design and a better payment system. Moreover, in the future, if the app does work, we will have the recording of millions of minutes of translation. This amount of data may help us train an algorithm that can outperform most of the free translation service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sadly, we stop the project after we parted ways to different colleges.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I was elected the president of our school’s Animal Protection Association in 2016. Then, I lead a team of 15 students to initiate the “Not Born to Perform” campaign to stop animal acrobatics in Xiamen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout our campaign, I organized charity sales and class presentations. At the peak of our campaign, we argued with local government representatives to stop school trips to a local animal circus and we held charity show at 5 different public areas in my city at the same time with over 120 student volunteers, donating all the money we raised to PETA Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is my firm belief that people’s joy should not be based on animals’ suffering. Thus, I was never fond of the idea of animal acrobatics. So I felt very uncomfortable when I learned my local government decided to invest about 100 million RMB (15 million USD) in building the largest animal circus in the world at my city, the “Ling Ling International Circus City” (厦门灵玲国际马戏城).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision has already been made by the government. Since demonstrations and appeals were not an option in my city, I focused on dissuading the public to visit. The easiest group of people I could reach was my schoolmates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, I wrote a speech and taught my teammates at the APA how to present. Then we talked to the school officials and presented our speed at each classroom. In the end, we received more than 100 signatures from students who vowed they would never visit animal circuses.

&lt;p&gt;Saying we were not happy would be an understatement. We were furious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I split my team into two groups. One group focus on reaching out to school and government officials to try to change the destination. But we knew the chances were slim since the local government was one of the investors of the circus. The other group focused on campus-wide charity sales to raise awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We designed many merchandises and sold them at our on-campus charity sale. And we went back to the classroom again to pitch our idea and dissuade students from participating. But since there were only 2 school trips in our 3 years in high school, it was hard to dissuade students. Thus, I reframed the talk from “No Circus” to “My Last Trip to Circus”. We asked students to think what how do they feel if they were the animals and ask them to make this their first and final trip to animal circuses.&lt;/p&gt;

    Charity sale
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;col-4&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;/images/projects/APA/merch3.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/APA/merch3.JPG&quot; class=&quot;w-100&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    Yep, that's me
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;phase-3-in-society&quot;&gt;Phase 3: In Society&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, we did not manage to change the destination for our school trip. Many people, including myself, ended up going to the circus. This should be the end of our campaign, but, as you may have known, giving up is never an option for me. I wanted to raise more people’s awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During that time, I was also one of the chief organizers of the 2017 Amoy Youth Elite Summit. Bridging the gap between different organizations have always been my thing. Thus, I wanted to motivate the participants of the Summit to help us with our campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the summit, I gave 50 RMB(7.4 USD) to each team as their initial fund. Each team has 3 days to plan out an executable plan to advocate for the rejecting animal circuses. And they would act out their plan on the fourth day. The participation was, of course, voluntary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was like a little experiment because I had no idea what they can come up within 3 days and how many people will even show up. But it turned out to be a great success. On the day of the event, about 120 students joined our event as organizers. We held charity sales and charity shows at two shopping districts (ZhongShang Road中山路, ShaPoWei沙坡尾), a shopping mall (SM), a public park (WuYi Squar五一广场) and our school at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, we educated many pedestrians and received more than 500 signatures. We raised about 3600 RMB in four hours. And the budget for the whole event was only 550 RMB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SSDCXI stands for Space Settlement Design Club in Xiamen No.1 High School. It is a club I founded in my 10th grade to participate in the International Space Settlement Design Competition which was sponsored by NASA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started the club with nothing but passion. But after my 2 years of leading and advising the club, our club won the first prize in China qualifying round three times, won the gold medal in China final once, the runner-up prize in world semi-final in New Delhi, India twice and the Dick Edwards Award for Outstanding Leadership twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-1-the-founding&quot;&gt;Chapter 1: The Founding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After recruiting 12 members, I founded the club in the spring of 2016. We have the same goal: to design a space settlement. But the problem was nobody knew what the heck we should do. I mean, it is a freaking space settlement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competition required us to design a space settlement orbiting Mercury. Basically, we need to write a 40-page proposal with 3D rendered graphs describing the settlement’s outer structural design(material, dimension, etc), inner city layout(road placement, apartment floor plan, etc), daily operation(food, water,etc) and automation design(contingency plan, industrial robots, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My job, as the founder and president, is to lead my team to make something out of nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
    
      &lt;a href=&quot; /images/projects/ssdcxi/team.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    
        &lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;Meet the Team&lt;/p&gt;
    


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-2-try-fail-learn-repeat&quot;&gt;Chapter 2: Try, Fail, Learn, Repeat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a high school freshman, I have no idea about how to lead an engineering design team so I just followed my hunch. Before the competition starts, in order to train my teammates how to use 3D modeling softwares, I invited professors from local university to gave lectures. To inform my teammate about how to design, I read through several space settlement proposals and gave talks about physics and design every week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After about 2 months preparation, the 12 of us received our first RFP(Request For Proposal), requesting us to design a sun-facing polar space settlement orbiting Mercury. To achieve our goal, I deployed a quick weekly iteration cycle in my team by organizing my team into multiple smaller task teams. Through each iteration, I can provide quick feedback to my teammates. As a result, my team and I managed to design multiple versions of the same system quickly, each time better than the last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row text-center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-4&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;/images/projects/ssdcxi/overall1.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/ssdcxi/overall1.JPG&quot; class=&quot;w-100&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
        V1.0
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-4&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;/images/projects/ssdcxi/overall2.png&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/ssdcxi/overall2.png&quot; class=&quot;w-100&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
        V2.0
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-4&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;/images/projects/ssdcxi/overall3.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/ssdcxi/overall3.jpg&quot; class=&quot;w-100&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
        V3.0
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I needed to work with my teammates to repeatedly revise their designs, like how we revised the outer structure of our settlement more than eleven times to better accommodate Mercury’s extreme environment. Other times, I facilitated brainstorming sessions for my club members in front of a blackboard for an entire afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 4 months of hard work, we made it: A 70-page proposal for a space settlement designed by us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that I studied at a regular public high school in China, meaning our class started at 7:15 am and finished at 9:45 pm. So I am very grateful that my teammates were willing to follow me to accomplish this almost impossible task on top of our heavy curriculum. Working with you guys under high pressure is one of the best experience in my life. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Outer Structure V1.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Outer Structure V2.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-3-the-firsts&quot;&gt;Chapter 3: The Firsts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After submitting our proposal in August, I thought this would be the end of our journey. I mean, after all, we were an inexperienced team participating in this competition for the first time. Finishing the proposal on time was a miracle in and of itself, there is no way we can be in the China Final.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little did I know, this was just the start of a fulfilling two-year journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may have guessed, we became the first team from my province/state winning the first prize in qualifying round. In China final, I was elected President to lead a simulated aerospace company Vulture which consisted of 48 students to design a new space settlement. But this time, I only have 24 hours and 36 of the 48 students were people I have never met before. By coordinating between departments, I lead the design of an underground settlement on the surface of Mercury in 24 hours. Sadly, my company only won the runner-up prize, meaning my school was not qualified for the world semi-final in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But giving up was never an option for my team and I. So after the competition, my team and I spent one month designed and redesigned a new proposal based on the initial one. Those were some of the darkest hours in my high school life, because my ACT test, my mid-terms for 5 subjects in school and the deadline for submission were less than 10 days apart. But we made it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/projects/ssdcxi/robo2.png&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/ssdcxi/robo2.png&quot; class=&quot;w-100&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/projects/ssdcxi/HF.png&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/ssdcxi/HF.png&quot; class=&quot;w-100&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Automation&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Human Factor&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Structure&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may have guessed, we became the first team from my province/state participating in world semi-final in New Delhi, India and I was the only Chinese elected as President during the competition. This time, I need to lead a 54-student company consists of students from 3 different countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;First Club Meeting&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Medals&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Yep,that's me&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-4-growth&quot;&gt;Chapter 4: Growth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winning or losing one match is normal, but what’s hard is how to transfer the knowledge we learned and make SSDCXI a bigger and better club. So here is what I did to expand my club from 12 members to 40 members in two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;web-design&quot;&gt;Web Design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are a tech club. Naturally, we need a website, preferably, a cool one. But the problem was nobody in my team knew how to design a website. So naturally, we taught ourselves how to do so. I spent the summer of 2017 working on this website. This is the first website I have ever designed: &lt;a href=&quot;http://ssdcxi.space&quot;&gt;ssdcxi.space&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is designed with the goals of introducing our club to prospective members and recording our club’s history. It is now maintained by my successors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image-wrapper&quot;&gt;
    
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://ssdcxi.space&quot; title=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    
    &lt;br /&gt;
    


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- source from https://superdevresources.com/image-caption-jekyll/ --&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;video-editing&quot;&gt;Video Editing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was hard to describe what we do in one poster, (even though we designed multiple ones), so I wanted to shot a promotional video for my club to recruit new members. But the problem was, again, nobody in my team knew how to do that. So naturally, we taught ourselves how to do so. My friends helped me with the footage and I spent about 2 days editing this video. Keep in mind this was made by a guy with zero editing background, so it may not be the best promotional video you’ve seen. You can check out the full video here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are in China, you can check it out &lt;a href=&quot;https://v.qq.com/x/page/c0386c9vi4t.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sponsorship-negotiation&quot;&gt;Sponsorship Negotiation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the competition, we needed to travel to Beijing and India. Thus, we need some kind of sponsorship to cover our cost. Since my school had no tradition of sponsoring external competitions, I had many meetings with my school’s officials and education head to persuade them to reimburse some of our cost. Mr.Chen, our club advisor, helped me a lot during the process. I also traveled to the other side of the city multiple times to negotiate and secure corporate sponsorship from EIC(启德教育集团). In the end, our hotels and dining were reimbursed by my school and plane tickets were sponsored by EIC, saving about 30,000 RMB for my team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;event-planning&quot;&gt;Event Planning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second year of my club, I wanted to introduce more people to experience the joy of working in an engineering design team. So, we held the XYSSDC(Xiamen Youth Space Settlement Developer Conference) in the winter of 2018. It was a 5-day winter camp where we trained 60 high school students coming from across the province about how to design space settlement. This is a story worth its own page.

The biggest event we hold every year is a five-day non-profit summer camp called Amoy Youth Elite Summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This camp is designed with the idea of bringing entrepreneurial high school students across Fujian Province together. The admission is highly competitive so applicants need to go through one round of written test and two rounds of interview to be admitted. We usually received 500-700 applicants per year in 2017 and 2018 and we only enrolled 108 students each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me and my team’s job in this summit were to organize every aspect of the whole 5-day event from planning to executing, from marketing to financing, from finding speakers to media relations. We spent the countless sleepless night so that we could present an interesting and educational experience for all the participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that all the pictures used in this article were taken by the hard-working student photographers in our department. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-ayes&quot;&gt;What is AYES?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AYES stands for Amoy Youth Elite Summit. It is a summer camp that is planned, organized and implemented entirely by high school students in the Practice Department of Student Union in Xiamen No.1 High School.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(PS: People in China usually do not associate the word “Elite” with elitism or the societal elites. It is a common term people use to describe the top among their peers.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;for-participants&quot;&gt;For Participants&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants first need to go through a rigorous screening process so that they can stand out among the 500-700 applicants each year. Once they are admitted, they would see the five-day summit would consist of two parts. The first part is team building activities which take about one day and a half. Participants will work as a team to play through various role-playing, team building, and alternate reality game. This includes solving puzzles, piecing stories lines together and detecting minute clues.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;Participants playing Alternate Reality Games&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part is what we call Theme activity which takes up the rest of the event. Each year the summit will pick a different theme. Participants will attend talks from professionals, entrepreneurs, and professors in that field. The team will work together to come up with a solution to solve a specific problem related to that field. In the last day, they will present their ideas to a panel of judges. In the past, we have participants getting an internship offer from the judges because of their performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than these two major parts, participants can join many small activities that are sprinkled throughout the event. For example, they can learn how to dance in the dance lesson we offered. They can also participate in company tours, volunteering activities and the ballroom dance in the closing ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these activities are compacted in five days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;for-organizers&quot;&gt;For Organizers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As organizers, our role is to make sure all the aforementioned stuff happen. We usually started planning the summit in February. Our team consisted of 20+ students. We would meet weekly to work on different tasks and make sure everything went smoothly during the event. This included negotiating with corporate sponsors, designing and play-testing alternate reality games, finding keynote speakers, coming up with marketing materials, and most importantly coming up with the theme for each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am responsible to design the Theme activity. So I lead a team to come up with the theme for each year. We are responsible for implementing the theme, finding speakers, reaching out to the company for tours and organizing volunteering activity. I also help out other departments in areas of sponsorship negotiation and designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ayes-2016--building-your-brand&quot;&gt;AYES 2016 – “Building Your Brand”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s theme was Building Your Brand, namely, we wanted to cultivate participants entrepreneurial mindset and taught them basic entrepreneurial tools like branding, product/market fit, user research etc. To implement this idea, my team worked on writing the request for proposal for the participants. In order to introduce the idea of a business plan, I also lead my team to come up with three companies so that the participants could draw an analogy in terms of scope and structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the summit, I had the honor to give the opening remarks for the event. The 5-day summit went smooth(-ish). In the last day of the summit, the 12 teams all presented their start-up companies and their plan to brand and advertise their products. It was a great success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the summit, it is customary to elect the next leadership board for the department. Since I have founded &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/2015/fall/SSDCXI&quot;&gt;my club&lt;/a&gt; and I was also the president of the school &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/2015/fall/APA&quot;&gt;Animal Protection Association&lt;/a&gt;, I declined to run for the leadership position. To my surprise, the previous leadership appointed me as the Department Advisor and added a fourth position in the leadership board for me. I felt grateful for their trust in me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this is my first year in the department, I did not try my bold ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s about to change real quick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ayes-2017--marketing--commercials&quot;&gt;AYES 2017 – “Marketing &amp;amp; Commercials”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my second year organizing the summit. As a kid who grew up watching TV, I wanted to teach participants how companies market their products and more specifically, how do they shoot commercials?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the summit more immersive, I lead my team to come up with a fake company Overlap.Inc and its product lines. So in this summit, we organizers would become a company that called for tender. And participants would form teams to bid their commercial and marketing ideas to us. In the end, the judges will be representatives from our company, the team that won the contract wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;overlapinc&quot;&gt;Overlap.Inc&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make this company realistic, we came up with a 9-page document detailing the company’s history and product lines. We asked participants to shoot commercials for our latest product: Overcup II, which was a smart IoT drinking cup that was transparent and could track your drinking habit. If you are interested, you can read to whole RFP &lt;a href=&quot;/images/projects/AYES/2017RFP.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We gave each team a silicon cup for their project. But since the cup was supposed to be an IoT device, we needed to design an app to build the atmosphere. The problem was nobody knew how to build an app. Naturally, we taught ourselves how to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-fake-mobile-app&quot;&gt;A Fake Mobile App&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a fake mobile app in the sense that it couldn’t really connect to the cup we gave participants. But it had all the major features: menu, login screen, and drinking data visualization, so it was good enough for creating the atmosphere and shooting commercials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we wanted to accommodate all devices, we designed a web app instead of an IOS or Android app. As of the writing of this article, the server that hosted the app is still running. So you can check it out by scanning the QR code in the bottom of the RFP &lt;a href=&quot;/images/projects/AYES/2017RFP.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;apa-x-ayes&quot;&gt;APA X AYES&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always felt AYES should be more than just a 5-day summit where students can have fun and learn. I felt like when we gather the top 108 students from across Fujian province, we could achieve something great and have a social impact. With that belief, I experimented with this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that time, I was also the president of the school &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/2015/fall/APA&quot;&gt;Animal Protection Association&lt;/a&gt;. I really like the idea of bridging two organizations together to achieve something great. So that’s exactly what we did. In this voluntary activity, we gave each team who wish to participate 50 CNY as their initial fund. They needed to come up with an executable plan within three days. On the fourth day of the summit, they would head out and raise funds for animal protection cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the event, I really had no idea how many people would even show up, but the event turned out to be a great success. More than 120 students volunteered and we held charity events at 5 different public space in Xiamen at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ayes-2019--artificial-intelligence&quot;&gt;AYES 2019 – “Artificial Intelligence”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I officially “retired” in 2017, to my surprise, two years later the current members of Student Union still reached out to me for advice for the 2019 AYES. So if you participated in the AYES 2019, you can probably see traces of me in the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished my freshman year at CMU in June 2019. About a week or so after I got back to China, the current organizers called me up and asked me to join the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;solving-pain-points-with-ai&quot;&gt;Solving Pain Points with AI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme for this year is Artificial Intelligence. This was a hard topic. One hand we couldn’t make the event too technical since many participants didn’t know how to code. On the other hand, the event couldn’t be too business oriented or else technical students who came to the summit just for the theme would be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was really tough since I basically worked with them to re-plan the whole event and we had less than a month to achieve that before the summit took place in July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But eventually, we came up with a very balanced approach that satisfied both technical and non-technical students. Want to know what it was? Join the 2019 AYES and experience it yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have spent a great amount of my high school years in AYES and the practice department. The people I have met there and the things we achieved together will always be one of my fondest memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an honor to be a part of this team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
